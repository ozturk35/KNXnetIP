# KNXnetIP Stack in C Language
Repository for KNXnetIP Interface Project

Implementation of KNXnetIP C. This project is targeted for ESP32-S3.

The KNX IP Interface in C language to be implemented by using the KNXnet/IP protocol stack. This protocol stack consists of the following components:

1. KNXnet/IP Client: This is responsible for connecting to the KNXnet/IP server and sending/receiving KNXnet/IP data.

2. KNXnet/IP Server: This is responsible for receiving KNXnet/IP data from the KNXnet/IP client and forwarding it to the KNX devices.

3. KNX Device: This is responsible for sending/receiving KNX data to/from the KNXnet/IP server.

The implementation of the KNX IP Interface in C language would involve writing the code for each of these components. The code would typically include functions for establishing and managing connections with the KNXnet/IP server, sending/receiving KNXnet/IP messages, and parsing/generating KNX messages.
